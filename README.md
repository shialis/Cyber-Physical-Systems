# Instructions for Executing the Machine Learning Code

## Step 1: Uploading Training Files

1. Open my Google Colab link, also provided in the report. [Google Colab Submission Link](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1uqdOuJvj1XT-ClYGwE3idWrGPkCCqLaE?usp=sharing)
2. Navigate to the "Files" tab on the left-hand side.
3. Click on "Upload to session storage".
4. Upload the test and train files:
   - **Binary Classification Files**: TestingDataBinary TrainingDataBinary
   - **Multi-Class Classification Files**: TestingDataMulti TrainingDataMulti

## Step 2: Executing Code Segments

1. Each code segment represents a different machine learning method.
2. Run each code segment to generate results file.
3. The results will be saved in the output directory with appropriate file names.

**Note** For both Part A and Part B, the best solution was found to be the Random Forest Classifier. Thus, the best results will be achieved when running that code snippet.
